## Visualization Usage
To try the visualization tool out, you'll need to run the [animate.py](https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/OpenQuadruped/blob/master/visualization/animate.py) python file with the proper libraries installed. (matplotlib 3.0.3 supported).

You can then use keyboard controls: use x, y, z, a, p, r to select (x axis, y axis, z axis, yaw, pitch, roll), and then the up and down buttons to increment the selected position. If you click '1' on your keyboard, it will reset the position. 

Right now, if you try to go to an impossible pose that would result in collisions, the body will do some weird things. If that happens, just click "1" on your keyboard to reset the position. 

*Note: Pitch and Roll are currently not working. I am currently trying to fix that.*
